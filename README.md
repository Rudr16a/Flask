# Flask
# Flask for Data Science 

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Flask, a lightweight web framework, for creating a simple web application that integrates data science functionalities. The application showcases how to deploy data science models and visualizations on the web, making them accessible and interactive.

## Features
- **Data Upload**: Allows users to upload datasets for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and plots to visualize data trends and patterns.
- **Model Deployment**: Integration of pre-trained machine learning models for prediction and inference.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for accessing model predictions programmatically.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- Flask 2.0+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-data-science.git
    cd flask-data-science
    ```
2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Flask application**:
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Key Components
- **app.py**: The main Flask application file where routes and logic are defined.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML files for rendering web pages.
- **static/**: Contains static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.
- **models/**: Directory for storing machine learning models.
- **data/**: Directory for storing datasets.

## Routes
- `/`: Home page
- `/upload`: Page for uploading datasets
- `/visualize`: Page for visualizing data
- `/predict`: Page for making predictions using the model
- `/api/predict`: API endpoint for model predictions

## Example
1. **Upload Dataset**: Navigate to the upload page, choose a CSV file, and upload it.
2. **Visualize Data**: View the uploaded data in various charts and graphs on the visualize page.
3. **Make Predictions**: Enter the required input data on the predict page to get predictions from the deployed model.
